# Passenger-Jet-Seating-Assignments
Another Leap test. You're an Airline. Due to COVID you need to plan for SOCIAL DISTANCING on your planes. First Class is not a problem.  But in Economy you wish to only sell appropriate seats and prereserve seats for adequate separation. On on booking you need to give flyers specific seat assignments. It's not enough, you feel to just reserve all the middle seats since your passengers would only be distant enough from those beside them,  but not from those ahead or behind. Run this on a Quantum computer.
