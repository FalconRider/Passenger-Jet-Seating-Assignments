# Passenger-Jet-Seating-Assignments
Another Leap test. You're an Airline . Due to COVID you need to plan for SOCIAL DISTANCING on your planes. First Class is not a problem.  But in Economy you wish to only sell appropriate seats and pre reserve seats for  adequate separation. On on booking you need to give flyers specific seat assignments. It's not enough, you feel to just reserve all the B and E seats since your passengers would be distant  enough from those beside them,  but not from those ahead or behind.
